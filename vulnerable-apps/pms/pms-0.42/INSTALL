To set up the build environment for PMS, type:
$ ./autogen.sh

If all went well, configure the build with:
$ ./configure

If there were error messages address them -- you may have missing libraries. 
Then run the configure script again.
Otherwise, build PMS with:
$ make

You now have a PMS binary in the current directory -- you can run it with
$ ./pms

If you want to install system-wide:
$ su -
Password:
# make install

Or, on systems which use sudo:

$ sudo make install

You should then be able to run PMS by typing
$ pms
